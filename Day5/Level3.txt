An organization took up the exercise to find the Body Mass Index (BMI) of all the persons in a team of 10 members. For this create a program to find the BMI and display the height, weight, BMI, and status of each individual
Hint => 
Take user input for the person's weight (kg) and height (cm) and store it in the corresponding 2D array of 10 rows. The First Column stores the weight and the second column stores the height in cm
Create a Method to find the BMI and status of every person given the person's height and weight and return the 2D String array. Use the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). Note unit is kg/m^2. For this convert cm to meter
Create a Method that takes the 2D array of height and weight as parameters. Calls the user-defined method to compute the BMI and the BMI Status and stores in a 2D String array of height, weight, BMI, and status.
Create a method to display the 2D string array in a tabular format of Person's Height, Weight, BMI, and the Status
Finally, the main function takes user inputs, calls the user-defined methods, and displays the result.

Find unique characters in a string using the charAt() method and display the result
Hint => 
Create a Method to find the length of the text without using the String method length()

Write a program to to check if a text is palindrome and display the result
Hint => 
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward
Logic 1: Write a method to compare the characters from the start and end of the string to determine whether the text is palindrome. The logic used here is as follows:
Set the start and end indexes of the text
Loop through the text and compare the characters from the start and the end of the string. If the characters are not equal, return false
Logic 2: Write a recursive method to compare the characters from the start and end of the text passed as parameters using recursion. The logic used here is as follows:
First, check if the start index is greater than or equal to the end index, then return true.
If the characters at the start and end indexes are not equal, return false.
Otherwise, call the method recursively with the start index incremented by 1 and the end index
Logic 3: Write a Method to compare the characters from the start and end of the text using character arrays. The logic used here is as follows:
Firstly Write a Method to reverse a string using the charAt() method and return the reversal array.
Create a character array using the String method toCharArray() and also create a reverse array. Compare the characters in the original and reverse arrays to do a Palindrome check
